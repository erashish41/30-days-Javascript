// Object
// Objects are containers for Properties and Methods.
// Properties are named Values.
// Methods are Functions stored as Properties
// Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects.


// Activity 1: Object Creation and Access
// Task 1: create a object represents a book with properties like title, author, and year, and log the object to the console.
const book = {
    title: "best in the world",
    author: "william",
    year: 2024,
}
console.log(book);

// Task 2: access title and author in console.
const title1 = book.title
console.log(title1);

const author1 = book.author
console.log(author1);


// Activity 2: Object Methods
// : Task 3: Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's 
//      title and author, and log the result of calling the method.


// : Task 4: Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter(year) and updates
//       the book's year property then log the updated object.

// Activity 3: Nested Objects
// : Task 5: Ccess and get harrep rene tirary and the titles oparties iens in the libraks (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console.
// Activity 4: The this Keyword
// • Task 7: Add a method to the book object that uses the this keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log the result of calling this method.
// Activity 5: Object Iteration
// • Task 9: Use a fier. keyS and iterate aert merperties of the bo kelsent and les of che open and its value.
// Feature Request:
// 2: Lrary Object Siri : Create a scrpe that dernes a tay Objet containing an aray of bot objets and loes the dirarys detalts.
// 3. Object Iteration Script: Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using for... in loop and Object. keys / Object. values .
// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// • Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
// • Understand and use the this keyword in object methods.
// • Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
// • Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
