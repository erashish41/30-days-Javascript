// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// • Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// • Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// • Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// • Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// • Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// • Compare values using comparison operators.
// • Combine conditions using logical operators.
// • Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
