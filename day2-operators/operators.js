// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let x1 = 80;
let y1 = 12;
let c1 =  x1 + y1;
console.log(c1)

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let x2 = 590;
let y2 = 350;
let c2 =  x2 - y2;
console.log(c2)

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let x3 = 400;
let y3 = 20;
let c3 =  x3 * y3;
console.log(c3)

// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let x4 = 80;
let y4 = 12;
let c4 =  x4/y4;
console.log(c4)

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let x5 = 80;
let y5 = 12;
let c5 =  x5 % y5;
console.log(c5)


// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// we can't use -=/+= operator with const variable
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
var a1 = 80;
a1 += 12;
console.log(a1)

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let b1 = 890;
b1 -= 350;
console.log(b1);


// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
function num(d1, e1){
    if(d1 > e1){
        console.log(`${d1} is greater than ${e1}`);
    }if (d1 < e1) {
        console.log(`${d1} is smaller than ${e1}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${d1} is equal to ${e1}`);
    }
}
num(80,80)


// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.



// • Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// • Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// • Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// • Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// • Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// • Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// • Compare values using comparison operators.
// • Combine conditions using logical operators.
// • Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
